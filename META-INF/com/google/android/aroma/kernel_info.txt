SkyWalker Kernel is made with love by @ItsRyuujiX 
which he's trying to give good experience for 
any users :) .
 
U can manage this kernel what do u want 
with Spectrum (if Supported) or other 
Kernel Managers like FKM & SmartPack.

<b>
And always Read Info. Latest Version Doesn't mean 
more better and Using much modules sometimes
will not make ur Perf more better .
</b>

Thank You for using this Kernel !. </q></@>
